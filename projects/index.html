		<h2>Hackman</h2>
		<p>A text-based word-guessing game developed in QBasic to run on an MS-DOS computer.  The player may select a difficulty which determines the number of letters in the word they are guessing.  The game provides hints by notifying the player if any of the letters entered are positioned in relation to the word being guessed.<br><a href="https://quintinherb.net/downloads/projects/Hackman.zip" style="text-align: center; width: 100%; display: block; margin-top: 10px;">Download</a></p>

		<h2>Disk Game</h2>
		<p>A simple Java game developed as an assignment for CS201 to explore and practice the concepts of object-oriented programming.  The player attempts to place as many disks in a given area within the allotted time.  The allotted time decreases with each disk placed.  If the player runs out of time, overlaps disks, or places a disk out of bounds, the game ends.</p>
