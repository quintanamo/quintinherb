	<h1 class="page_title">College:  A Brief Reflection</h1>
	<p class="blog_text">At the time of writing this, my sophomore year as a Computer Science student has ended.  Two out of the (hopefully) four years are finally out of the way, and I am very satisfied with the strides I have made as a programmer.</p>
	<p class="blog_text">It is somewhat difficult for me to believe I even considered any other field to study when in high school.  When other juniors were applying to colleges and deciding on their majors, I had absolutely no clue what I wanted out of myself.  Immediately, I pondered studying astronomy.  The peculiarity, vastness, and mystery of the universe has always intrigued me and I found it very desirable to lose myself in casual research about various topics such as black holes/white holes, dark matter, and quantum mechanics (all at a very basic level).</p>
	<p class="blog_text">Understanding career options and academic opportunites for such things were minimal, I decided to conceptualize a future as a writing major.  This surprised myself because I had always disliked English classes in schooling until about 11th grade when the teacher of the appropriately named "English 11" course praised my potential and insisted I pursued AP English Composition the next school year (and by insisted, I mean took my schedule and filled in the class herself).  This was a very flattering experience since I had little confidence in myself in any way.  The same teacher was also the AP English Composition and Creative Writing teacher.  I ended up taking both classes and thoroughly enjoyed both of them.</p>
	<p class="blog_text">As you can probably tell, I have not majored in any of those topics.  As far as Computer Science is concerned, I had some self-taught website development skills and an interest in technology with not much else aside from minimal practice with if-statements in Small Basic.  I suppose the potential high salary lured me in with the understanding that I'd be able to have the potential to create things, which is always appealing to me (hence the website stuff).</p>
	<p class="blog_text">Now, after four semesters' worth of Computer Science courses, I am very impressed with my performance (if I may stroke my own ego for a moment).  Hearing my peers speak of "AP Computer Science" classes and discussing their high grades while I righteously brag about taking the highest level computer course at my high school, which was keyboarding, provides a very interesting contrast.  The people I am surrounded by have dedicated so much to the subject while I practically walked in.  Luckily, I hit the ground running and perform at what I feel is a high level within the subject.  The coursework is very enjoyable to me and I feel I do well on all of the assignments.</p>
	<p class="blog_text last">York College has taught me multitudes of information to help me become a succesful, well-rounded software engineer and I greatly anticipate what else is in store for me.</p>
