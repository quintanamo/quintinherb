	<h1 class="page_title">Beans Bot</h1>
	<p class="blog_text">For a decent while, I have been interested in developing a bot for Twitter.  I didn't have any particular goal in mind, but I knew I wanted to automate something, anything, using Twitter's API.  Now that I've grown my programming skills to the point where self-teaching is easier and I've become more capable, I decided it was time to make my bot.</p>
	<p class="blog_text">Initially, I had no idea what bot I was going to make.  I thought about a bot that posted random things, but I didn't know what I wanted it to post.  I made a bot that replies with random obvious facts, but it wasn't receiving a lot of attention.  Then I decided that I wanted a bot that would retweet a common, yet not daily used word, whenever a user tweeted a status containing it.  This word was "beans", and that was the birth of <a href="https://www.twitter.com/BeansBot1">@BeansBot1</a>.</p>
	<p class="blog_text">The result of the beans bot was rather surprising.  There were a lot of people who accepted the humor and found the bot appealing while only a few minority insisted I was an idiot for creating it.  I agreed with that minority.  I am still in disbelief that so many people tweet the word "beans" in such a large volume.  So large, in fact, that the account reaches tweet limits within very short amounts of time.  This is rather unfortunate because when people start catching onto the bot, the attempt to interact with it, but the bot ignores them because Twitter says it may not reply until the restriction is over.</p>
	<p class="blog_text last">I can only hope that through the bot I am able to spread positivity, joy, and a few cheap laughs to those who might need it.</p>
