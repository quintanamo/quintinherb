                                The York County Astronomical Society Radio Telescope project is currently being developed by York College of Pennsylvania students enrolled in the senior software design course. The aim of the project is to deliver real-world experience to students by exposing them to communication between both clients and teammates as well as serving as a joint operation between software engineers and mechanical engineers. There are five subteams within the software side of the project: control room, front-end, back-end, mobile, and VR, which must all work together to deliver a functional, satisfactory product.

                                My involvement with the project began as a junior computer science student seeking opportunities that allow me to challenge myself. My advisor recommended that I join the team as an independent study student that will perform the same duties as my peers who are enrolled in the actual course so that I may assist where help is needed and facilitate the transition into the next year's senior software design team as a team lead. I started on the back-end subteam where I helped maintain the project's database to provide functionality, data persistence, and analytics to other subteams and the clients.

                                Next semester, as a senior software student, I took on the responsibility of being the overall software lead of all of the five subteams on the project.  This experience allowed me to practice organizing scrum meetings, interfacing more frequently with the clients and the capstone team, organizing presentations, and making decisions that affect the project as a whole.  Additionally, I transitioned to the front-end team since previous members had graduated and left a gap in the team.  This added responsibility and wearing of many hats has been an enjoyable, valuable challenge that I hope to experience something similar again.  My favorite part was implementing astronomical algorithms to draw celestial objects in a JavaScript canvas object.

                                In my cryptology course, I was tasked with deciphering various texts that were ciphered by shifting a given letter within a given range. For example, if a message is "salad" and each letter may be shifted 0-4 places, one possible encipherment is "uanbg". While it is easier to decipher the message when the range is small, such as 0-2, doing larger ranges by hand becomes time-consuming and patterns become difficult to find. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text">
                                My solution to this was to first create a Python script that read 40 public domain books and keep count of how often each word in each text appears with a dictionary. This allowed me to find commonly used words across all 40 books with the intention that such common words could potentially appear in the enciphered messages. To filter out words with low numbers of occurrences, I simply took the top 10,000 words by appearance count. After writing the word list to a text file, I made a second script that takes an input of an enciphered message and the maximum range of shifts that were used when enciphering it. The script then generated shifted alphabets and searched for patterns that match potential words at a given letter. The script would then keep track of the letter each potential word match was found at and then output it in an appropriate position for easy reading. This was a very successful project as it helped find word matches that were perhaps too large to be a coincidence and which lead to deciphering the texts.

                                With a Raspberry Pi, my curiosity grew in awe at the potential a computer the size of a credit card held. I decided to combine two of my strongest passions with it: programming and soccer. This project would utilize the Rasbperry Pi's GPIO to light up LEDs based on the current match status of my favorite soccer team Arsenal. The script on the Pi would request score data from Arsenal's website and output Arsenal's status in their latest match and output a visualization of the status using four LEDs. A green LED indicates that they are winning, yellow indicates drawing, and red indicates losing. Since a match isn't being played at every hour of the day (how exhausting that would be), a blue LED indicates if the status is from a live match, otherwise, it is the last match's status.

                                Find Us Food is a simple webpage that utilizes HERE's mapping API to find a random restaurant within a given radius. This project was independently developed and presented by myself for York College of Pennsylvania's 2019 Hackathon. A user may enter the postal code of the area they would like to eat and filter restaurant types to suit their interests. For example, if I was interested in only burger joints, pizza places, or fast food, I can use the checkboxes provided to find restaurants that fit that exact criteria.

                                For my software engineering course, I had to take on a personal project and a team project. For the team project, my group worked on a web application that allows students within the college to share their skills and ideas to collaborate on a project. For example, if a student wants to make a mobile app to find vending machines on campus but doesn't know how, they may seek another student on the website who has mobile app development experience to help work on it. Students were able to create profiles displaying their interests and skills while also posting proposals either seeking help with a project or seeking to help somebody who needs it. They could also directly message a student from the post they found.

                                Being overtaken by curiousity, I wanted to try developing a program that could run on MS-DOS using QBasic. Using a computer with MS-DOS installed on it, I developed a game where a player tries to guess a random secret word of a given length depending on the difficulty they selected. For example, an easy word would consist of only three letters, and the user must make a guess with that knowledge. After each guess, the game will provide hints indicating if a letter in the guess matches with the actual word. For example, if the word is "ACE" and the user guessed "ARK", the game will indicate a single match since "A" appears in the same position for both the guess and the answer.

                                As an intern at KioWare, I worked on developing widgets for KioWare Server and experimented with making addins for KioWare for Android. The widgets provided analytical data for kiosk units on three separate levels: an individual kiosk, a group of kiosks, and all kiosks within a domain. This provided useful data for kiosk owners so they can identify how to improve their services. Additionally, I worked on custom development projects for clients.

                                As an intern at Johnson Controls, I worked on developing the next generation of touchscreen interfaces on chiller units. This entialed converting the current implimentation into a new architecture while documenting each new addition to the project. My duties also required deployment onto a simulated panel to test user interaction.

                            I am currently studying computer science at York College of Pennsylvania where I will graduate in May 2021.  Whenever possible, I try to seek out new and exciting things to learn about whether its related to computer science or my other hobbies. Outside of the classroom, I enjoy watching Premier League soccer, listening to music, going to Taco Bell, and coin collecting.  Currently, I am learning Swedish to prepare for whenever I am able to travel to Sweden.
