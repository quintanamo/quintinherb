		<h2>Hello!</h2>
		<img src="quintin.jpg" id="itMe">
		<p>My name is Quintin, and I am currently a sophomore Computer Science student at York College of Pennsylvania.  I am passionate about computers, writing, and hearing myself talk.  When I'm not occupied with schoolwork, I am an amateur table tennis champion, professional shower concert performer, and a motivated learner.  I also tutor fellow Computer Science students.</p>

		<h2>What I Do</h2>
		<p>I have an incomprehensibly huge passion for making websites.  From the early days of my uncle giving me a spiral-bound HTML book and making basic, plain web pages with blinding white backgrounds and unorganized, unstyled text to practicing every day after school during my senior year of high school, I have always had a love for seeing my concepts come to life on web pages.  Website development is one of the most fulfilling things I have ever done, and I feel that I will forever continue to adore it as a hobby.</p>
		<p>I am interested in helping those seeking to imprint their presence online.  Whether you are a college student, startup, or small business, I am more than happy to discuss the possibilities with you!  If you would like more information or have any questions, please contact me at <a href="mailto:quintin@quintinherb.net" style="font-style: italic;">quintin@quintinherb.net</a>.</p>
