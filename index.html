			<h3>Welcome!</h3>
			<p>&emsp;&emsp;Hello!  My name is Quintin, and I am a freelance front-end web developer!  I am currently enrolled at York College of Pennsylvania to study Computer Science.  I am currently looking to work with individuals, startups, and small businesses trying to bring their presense online.</p>

		<div class="sectionB">
			<h3>Why Me?</h3>
			<p>&emsp;&emsp;Because I am looking to build my portfolio, I am offering totally custom websites at very generous prices.  Your website will have a responsive design, meaning it will look great on any device it is viewed on!  I will manage the domain name registration and hosting for you while you kick back and <i>relax</i>!  Have an idea that you're ready to bring to life?  Email me at <a href="mailto:quintin@quintinherb.net">quintin@quintinherb.net</a>!  Feel free to ask me any questions you may have.  I look forward to doing business with you!</p>

			<h3>About Me:</h3>
			<img src="me.jpg" alt="me.jpg" id="welcomePic">
			<p>&emsp;&emsp;It was a cold February evening in 1998 when I first came into this world.  Since then, I've had an infinitely-growing passion for making things.  Whether it was a neat Hot Wheels track with a loop or the website you're looking at right now, I have always received joy from seeing my fantasies flourish before my eyes.</p>
			<p>&emsp;&emsp;Aside from the website gig, in my free time I enjoy playing table tennis, collecting records, and writing.  I also have an enormous interest in astronomy.  In the near future, I plan on beginning to work on a novel, though I don't have many ideas at the moment.</p>
